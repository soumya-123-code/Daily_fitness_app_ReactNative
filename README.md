🌐 How to Host
How to Deploy the Project
To host the Daily Fitness App built with React Native, follow these steps:

Create a Build for Production: Use Expo to generate production-ready builds for Android or iOS:

bash
Copy
Edit
expo build:android
or

bash
Copy
Edit
expo build:ios
Sign the Build (if required):

For Android, download the .apk file for testing or distribute it via Google Play.
For iOS, follow the App Store guidelines to upload and sign your .ipa file.
Host a Web Version (Optional):

Run the following command to build the app for web:
bash
Copy
Edit
expo build:web
Upload the web-build folder to a hosting provider like Netlify or Vercel.
Hosting Back-End (if applicable):

If your app depends on back-end APIs, ensure the API endpoints are hosted using services like Heroku, AWS, or Render.
Environment Variables:

Make sure to securely store API keys (e.g., for Rapid API) in .env files and use services like Expo Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager.
